QUICK FIX FOR REJECTION REASON ERROR:

1. Stop your dev server (Ctrl+C)

2. Delete the .next folder:
   rm -rf .next   (Mac/Linux)
   OR
   rmdir /s /q .next   (Windows)

3. Run: npx prisma generate

4. Restart server: npm run dev

5. Try rejecting a store again - it should work!

The error happens because Prisma client wasn't regenerated to include the rejectionReason field.
